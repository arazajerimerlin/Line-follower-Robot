# Line-follower-Robot

This project is a Line Following Robot designed to automatically detect and follow a visible line on the ground, usually a black line on a white surface or vice versa. The robot uses infrared (IR) sensors to sense the contrast between the line and the surrounding surface and adjusts its movement accordingly. By continuously monitoring sensor input and controlling the motors in real time, the robot is able to stay on track without human intervention. This project introduces fundamental concepts of robotics, sensor-based control systems, motor driving, and embedded programming, making it ideal for beginners and students learning autonomous robot navigation.
